							The title for this presentation, You Failed... Now We Rule!!! comes from a compilation album released in 2013. The album was to showcase several underground metal bands that had been growing within Angola after the turmoil of the Civil War, which lasted from 1975 to 2002. All of the bands from that album were frontrunners of the documentary "Death Metal Angola"(which was difficult to find, but is available on Vimeo for a Rent price of $3.99 and a Buy of $12.99.)
