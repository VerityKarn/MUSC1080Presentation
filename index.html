							<br>
							The title for this presentation, <a href="https://cuberecords.bandcamp.com/album/you-failed-now-we-rule-a-nossa-vez">You Failed... Now We Rule!!! comes from a compilation album released in 2013</a>. The album was made to showcase several underground metal bands that had been growing within Angola after the turmoil of the Civil War, which lasted from 1975 to 2002, and is one of the few existing albums of metal to even come from Angola. All of the bands from the album were featured within the documentary "Death Metal Angola"(which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpE3V50Bem4">is available on Youtube for a Rent price of $4.99</a>. It's a fascinating dive into musical expression within a nation trying to pull itself together, and just how much metal has changed people's lives across the world.).
							<br>
							<br>
							However, metal will not be the focus for this project. I've spent my last project showing why Metal could be seen as a genre of one's experience with suffering, and I don't believe that metal captures all the interesting changes within Angolan music over the last century. Rather, I believe that this album and documentary serve as a good example of how music from Angola is continuing to shift. What I will be focusing on is a thin strip of the Angolan musical experience, but it should not be seen as a complete picture of such. The last two decades, after the Civil War has ceased, has seen a tremendous amount of musical engagement from the citizens of Angola, including electronic music, rock, and hip-hop, and I am looking forward to seeing the continuing wave of music that comes from the region. Instead, let's make sure that we're clear on what our focus is.(d)

						<h2>Goals of this Presentation</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Breifly explain the last century of Angolan history</li>
							<li class="fragment">Show Music's relationship to that history</li>
							<li class="fragment">Generate interest in the growth of Angolan Music</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">

							Overall, my goal for this presentation can be summed up in three parts. First(d), I hope to explain some of the history of Angola over the past century, as I believe that most people within the United States is unfamiliar with this region of Africa. Yet, Angola's place within the Cold War is a brutal example of the sorts of conditions that much of the world dealt with, which Americans have been mostly isolated from. Even today, when we hear of what happens in Ukraine or Taiwan, there is a vast separation between our American reality and the realities of those who have been subjugated by larger nations within a wider conflict.
							<br>
							<br>
							Second(d), to show how music was connected to the turbulence of the nation, both as a way to politically advocate, and a way to process reality. Musicians, especially in the later part of the 20th century, were one of the groups most affected by the changes around them, and many took to their music as a way to both disseminate their ideas, and to capture the essence of what they experienced. As such, we will be looking at three separate artists from Angola: one prior to the Civil War, one during the Civil War, and one after the Civil War. Again, this will not be a thorough view of music in Angola, but the focus may help us understand how it shifted that music.
							<br>
							<br>
							Third(d), my hope is to generate some interest in currently existing music from Angola, as well as future works by Angolan artists. Out of the various proxy battlegrounds of the Cold War, Angola has been one of the most active. Yet, it's also generally ignored within a wider cultural examination of how the Cold War affected culture around the world. It is very easy to learn how the Cold War shifted cultural projects within the United States, Europe, Russia, and China. It is harder, but still possible, to find the effects within regions such as North Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. However, countries like Angola, which occupied the attention of the Soviet Union, China, the United States, and Portugal, are often relegated to little more than footnotes. It's difficult to find information regarding how Angola, alongside other countries such as Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, or Botswana, was impacted by the Cold War. However, understanding those effects could fill in gaps of our understanding of the widespread effects of the Cold War overall, especially for countries that were thrown into a conflict far larger than they'd hoped for. Angolan music is not just interesting by itself, but gives us an insight into an often overlooked portion of what was essentially a global conflict impacting billions.

							Now, I'm going to treat this presentation as a sequel to my previous presentation regarding music. By that, I mean that I'll reference facts stated in the previous part, and, important for this portion, I will leverage the information stated in my background previously to further widen previous influences on why I found an interest in Angolan music, and recent African music overall. With that, let's reiterate my geographic background.(d)
