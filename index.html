						<h1>You Failed... Now We Rule!!!</h1>
						<p>The Cold War's Influence on Angolan Music Identity</p>

						<aside class="notes">

							<br>
							<br>
							The title for this presentation, <a href="https://cuberecords.bandcamp.com/album/you-failed-now-we-rule-a-nossa-vez">You Failed... Now We Rule!!! comes from a compilation album released in 2013</a>. The album was made to showcase several underground metal bands that had been growing within Angola after the turmoil of the Civil War, which lasted from 1975 to 2002, and is one of the few existing albums of metal to even come from Angola. All of the bands from the album were featured within the documentary "Death Metal Angola"(which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpE3V50Bem4">is available on Youtube for a Rent price of $4.99</a>. It's a fascinating dive into musical expression within a nation trying to pull itself together, and just how much metal has changed people's lives across the world.).
							<br>
							<br>
							However, metal will not be the focus for this project. I've spent my last project showing why Metal could be seen as a genre of one's experience with suffering, and I don't believe that metal captures all the interesting changes within Angolan music over the last century. Rather, I believe that this album and documentary serve as a good example of how music from Angola is continuing to shift. What I will be focusing on is a thin strip of the Angolan musical experience, but it should not be seen as a complete picture of such. The last two decades, after the Civil War has ceased, has seen a tremendous amount of musical engagement from the citizens of Angola, including electronic music, rock, and hip-hop, and I am looking forward to seeing the continuing wave of music that comes from the region. Instead, let's make sure that we're clear on what our focus is.(d)

						<h2>Goals of this Presentation</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Breifly explain the last century of Angolan history</li>
							<li class="fragment">Show Music's relationship to that history</li>
							<li class="fragment">Generate interest in the growth of Angolan Music</li>
						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">

							Overall, my goal for this presentation can be summed up in three parts. First(d), I hope to explain some of the history of Angola over the past century, as I believe that most people within the United States is unfamiliar with this region of Africa. Yet, Angola's place within the Cold War is a brutal example of the sorts of conditions that much of the world dealt with, which Americans have been mostly isolated from. Even today, when we hear of what happens in Ukraine or Taiwan, there is a vast separation between our American reality and the realities of those who have been subjugated by larger nations within a wider conflict.
							<br>
							<br>
							Second(d), to show how music was connected to the turbulence of the nation, both as a way to politically advocate, and a way to process reality. Musicians, especially in the later part of the 20th century, were one of the groups most affected by the changes around them, and many took to their music as a way to both disseminate their ideas, and to capture the essence of what they experienced. As such, we will be looking at three separate artists from Angola: one prior to the Civil War, one during the Civil War, and one after the Civil War. Again, this will not be a thorough view of music in Angola, but the focus may help us understand how it shifted that music.
							<br>
							<br>
							Third(d), my hope is to generate some interest in currently existing music from Angola, as well as future works by Angolan artists. Out of the various proxy battlegrounds of the Cold War, Angola has been one of the most active. Yet, it's also generally ignored within a wider cultural examination of how the Cold War affected culture around the world. It is very easy to learn how the Cold War shifted cultural projects within the United States, Europe, Russia, and China. It is harder, but still possible, to find the effects within regions such as North Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. However, countries like Angola, which occupied the attention of the Soviet Union, China, the United States, and Portugal, are often relegated to little more than footnotes. It's difficult to find information regarding how Angola, alongside other countries such as Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, or Botswana, was impacted by the Cold War. However, understanding those effects could fill in gaps of our understanding of the widespread effects of the Cold War overall, especially for countries that were thrown into a conflict far larger than they'd hoped for. Angolan music is not just interesting by itself, but gives us an insight into an often overlooked portion of what was essentially a global conflict impacting billions.
							<br>
							<br>
							With that said, let's start with my background.(r)

						<p>Or, How I Gained an Interest in Angolan Music</p>

						<aside class="notes">

							Now, I'm going to treat this presentation as a sequel to my previous presentation regarding music. By that, I mean that I'll reference facts stated in the previous part, and, important for this portion, I will leverage the information stated in my background previously to further widen previous influences on why I found an interest in Angolan music, and recent African music overall. With that, let's reiterate my geographic background.(d)

						<aside class="notes">
							
							As I've stated in my previous presentation, I grew up in Cobleskill, NY. It had a population slightly under 5,000, but was still one of the bigger areas of Schoharie County in Upstate NY. Culture wise, it was an interesting mix between the sort of standoffish NY attitude mixed with an odd redneck pride. Musicals held equal value to Country and Classic Rock. And even if we drank the culture of the City, there was pride in being separated from those "soft liberal types". Cognitive dissonace was strong there, but there's some charm in the whole thing. It fed itself on its own myth. Unfortunately, for myself and some others, we just couldn't swallow that myth. And that's only one reason why the population is decreasing from the town these days.

							However, there were various influences I stumbled upon that shifted how I viewed the world, and what I took an interest in. My last presentation touched upon(d) the Music I found, mostly Kamelot and Nightwish, both pictured on the right. I also talked about(d) how I came across Nietzsche, and how that shifted my thinking during my move away from LDS life.
							<br>
							<br>
							However, the third element(d) of Story was only breifly mentioned. I had found two stories, Hellsing and Black Lagoon, both of which were a perfect mix of over-the-top hyperviolence mixed with a surprisingly deep appreciation for both history and culture. Further research into the making of both series led me to have a deep appreciation of operas and Cold War history. Of particular interest for this presentation is Black Lagoon.(d)

						<h2>Black Lagoon's Rocky Publication</h2>
						<ul>

						<aside class="notes">

							Black Lagoon is a monthly comic series made by Rei Hiroe that has been running since 2002, and had two animated seasons in 2006-07, with another animated run in 2013. While it's a series that's over two decades old, there are less chapters than the average monthly series that's been around for 5 years. Most of the published work was done prior to 2014(11 of the now 13 volumes were published by then). While it is still technically in production, the many hiatuses of the series has led to most treating the series as completed.
							<br>
							<br>
							It's hard to actually learn what's going on behind the scenes with Hiroe and Sunday GX, the publishing magazine, but most of the information available tells us of an author that was excited for his project, and even became quite happy with it's popularity among a wide audience. Prior to Black Lagoon, Hiroe tried to get four other series off the ground, all of which were cut from production within months, and most of which are impossible to find nowadays. Yet, as the series grew in popularity, there was apparently a dispute that occured in 2014 regarding publishing and ownership rights between Hiroe and Sunday GX. This led to the 4 year long hiatus that lost most fans, and it sent Hiroe into a depressive cycle. He has yet to recover, and mostly exists as a recluse these days.

						<h2>The Post-Cold War and Black Lagoon</h2>
						<ul>

							<li class="fragment">Placeholder</li>

						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">

							However, I continue to be a fan of the series. While most people follow the series for the action and the characters, what made me appreciate the series was a real dedication on Hiroe's part in capturing a sentiment that I hadn't seen anywhere else, and I still argue is one of the best series for capturing a significant element of the human experience. Black Lagoon, as far as I've seen, has been the best series at capturing the essence of the post-Cold War fallout than any other series. Specifically, there was a broad narrative of the US vs. USSR, and the collapse of the later led many to view the future with some hope that we'd move towards a brighter, peaceful future. But outside of the broad European/American narrative, there was a world that had felt most of the brunt of the Cold War, and were now stuck in a position of figuring out how to pick the pieces up on their own. Africa, the Middle East, SouthEast Asia, and South America were left beaten and bruised by the superpowers that had used them in some meta-war. Entire countries had become proxy battlegrounds and political chessboards, only to be dumped the moment they were irrelevant.
							<br>
							<br>
							For many of these nations, there was a wide population that had felt abandoned and betrayed. Some of the lesser known effects of the collapse of the Soviet Union was the rise of the Russian Mafia worldwide, the massive jump in opiate production in SouthEast Asia, the rise of cartels in South America, and civil wars throughout Africa. The end of the Cold War, especially in areas already dealing with political turmoil and poverty, was an uptick in crime and unrest. And all throughout these, there were two emotions that ruled, an existential ennui and rage. Black Lagoon, being set in 1995, perfectly captured these attitudes with a cavelier attitude towards violence, and a deep simmering rage against the world.

						<h2>Black Lagoon's Historical Reverence</h2>
						<ul>

							<li class="fragment">Placeholder</li>

						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">

							The best way to explain this is by going over one such example of how Black Lagoon tried to capture the sort of hopeless, violent world that most people felt. <a href="https://otakuusamagazine.com/the-creature-from-the-black-lagoon/">In an interview with Otaku Magazine</a>, Hiroe talked about one particular arc revolving around two Romanian characters called the "vampire twins", Hansel and Gretel. He started with the basic premise of twin child serial killers, and then proceeded to do research to find information to make the concept plausible. That led to him looking into the history of Romania, and their anti-abortion policies, and the effects that they had on child trafficking during that era. The result is what most fans consider to be the darkest story arc of the series.
							<br>
							<br>
							To keep it brief, Romania, in an effort to bolster their workforce, enacted several policies to prohibit contraceptives, tax those without children, and outlaw abortion. The result was an overflowing amount of orphans, as families in poverty couldn't handle the burden of new children. Since the 1980s, the Western world has been aware of the various abuses against orphans within state run orphanages. However, a lesser known effect, and one that has been near impossible to quantify, was the growth of human trafficking that resulted from those policies. At this point, <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/romania-urged-to-effectively-prosecute-human-traffickers-and-ensure-access-to-compensation-for-their-victims">it's generally accepted that Romania has been, and still is, one of the primary sources of those trafficked within Europe, with over half of them being children, and most used for sexual exploitation</a>. We are still learning of how deep that rabbit hole goes.
							<br>
							<br>
							In Black Lagoon, this was captured by the "vampire twins", who were trafficked out of Romania to star in pornographic snuff films spread throughout the black market. The result was their minds shattering, and the twins associated the act of killing with pleasure and life itself. While most characters in the show are criminals, willing to kill their own families if it could give them a leg up, the existence of the twins makes even them feel squimish. The series doesn't shy away from the twin\'s loss of humanity, with some fans arguing that it almost glorifies the depravity of the backstory. However, I don't see it that way.

						<h2>My Views on Black Lagoon's Violence</h2>
						<ul>

							<li class="fragment">Placeholder</li>

						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">

							It's no secret that Black Lagoon is a violent, raunchy series. Many fans actually use those elements as points of advertising. However, where I deviate from most fans is how I understand the relationship between violence portrayed within the series and the core themes. Much of the series is focused on people who find themselves at the edge of society, with several referring to Roanapuer, the fictional city where most of the series takes place, as the "edge of the world", with the inhabitants calling themselves the "living dead". Both thematically and narratively, the story bases itself around characters who have either been pushed to the outskirts, or those who willingingly push themselves out. These are people who are, as one character put it, "Dancing the dance of death", and have, to most of the world, become something beyond human. They've lost what makes them "normal" in the eyes of a changing post-Cold War world, and their inability or refusal of change has led them to the last corner of cowboy, rotten freedom available. The violence of the show is not a revelry in permitted acts. It is the last dance of people who can't exist anywhere else but within that violence.
							<br>
							<br>
							In the case of the "vampire twins", this dynamic becomes even more terrifying. The majority of their appearances are filled with every trope meant for horror characters. Their scenes are often shot at uncomfortable angles, with unsettling imagery and music, and they can often be heard laughing during some of the most horrific sequences of mutilation and massacres. However, by the time that particular story arc ends, we learn of their equally horrific background, and the audience comes to understand how the twins are victims of a world that literally used them for twisted pleasures. While most fans try to downplay the various elements of this story arc, I don't think they can do so without undermining some of the central themes of Black Lagoon. The twins, and how the other characters deal with them, showcase exactly why Black Lagoon stays within people's minds. The 20th century was home to some of the worst that humanity can give, and we're still trying to figure out just how deep some of those scars can be. For some, it pushed them past the edge of ever being able to have a "normal" life, and we may have created the conditions to perpetuate those horrors into the future. As I like to say often, the Cold War never ended. It just found a new generation and rebranded. But, the twins exist even beyond that. They're so broken that they unsettle characters that often spend their time mocking "normal" people. They exist to show that there are moral limits, even for the "living dead".

						<h2>How Black Lagoon Led to my Interest in Angola</h2>
						<ul>

							<li class="fragment">Placeholder</li>

						</ul>

						<aside class="notes">

							One of the antagonists that appears within the series is a group of South African mercenaries by the name of Extra Order(EO), which were very loosely based on the real life Private Military Corporation Executive Outcomes(EO) from South Africa. While the show depicts EO as a group of bloodthirsty thrill-seekers, the actual history of EO is fascinating as a microcosm of the wider Cold War occuring in Africa. Looking into EO, I learned, to a small extent, some about the South African Border War, where many of the soldiers of EO originally served, and the Angolan Civil War, where EO, as an organized group, first operated. They originally were contracted to assist in the training of government forces for the newly elected Angolan government, but as the intensity of fighting increased, Executive Outcomes provided men and armaments to the government forces.
							<br>
							<br>
							Reading up on Executive Outcomes, I learned how integral Angola was to wider forces. Portugal, Cuba, Soviet Russia, the United States, even Romania had a vested interest in the resources of Angola, and each contributed significantly to the conflict. The result, as often happens in proxy battlefields, was Angola's internal struggle for a cultural sense. With so many foreign interests, Angola's biggest struggle was for an identity that it could call its own. Music served as a foundational ground for that struggle.

							So, let's begin with the general musical culture that led up to the Civil War in 1975, and which played a part of the culture in the early days. As it is though, there is very little to go off of. For the most part, Angolan culture overall has never been the focal point of many academics, and especially music culture at that. Thankfully though, there are some albums that exist from that time. The real problem comes in trying to explain the history behind the artists. Unfortunately for us, an English speaking audience, many of the records regarding early writers has been lost to time, with recent revivals existing mostly within Angola itself. This wasn't just negligence. Part of the consequences of the Civil War was a concerted back and forth struggle for the cultural identity of Angola, and so many artists were banned, exiled, and even assassinated. Most of the information we have now is part of an effort to revive some of these artists.

							To begin with, let's start with two artists that were both influencial within the MPLA, the eventual victors of the Civil War: David Zè and Artur Nunes. As their stories are intertwined, we can look at them side by side.
							<br>
							<br>
							Both came from Luanda, a coastal Province in Angola. Zè was born to two Angolan natives, while Nunes was the son of an Angolan-American couple. Before persuing a career in music, Zè served the military while Nunes became a locksmith. However, both of them grew interested in politics, focusing on left-wing revolutionary ideas, and started to see music as a way to spread a message. Zè started in 1966, when he was encouraged by Urbano de Castro, a prominent singer at the time. Nunes started in 1970, when he started the band Luanda Show. Eventually, de Castro, Zè, and Nunes were scouted and recruited in 1975 by Agostinho Neto, the first president of the newly independant Angola, to help promote the ideas and culture of Angola. This included going to multiple rallies and demonstrations to perform the Angolan sound for people to hear.

							Unfortunately, as is often the case, the story of these three do not have a happy ending. On May 27, 1977, a coup was attempted by Nito Alves, who originally served as Interior Minister of Angola before his removal in October 1976. Still, Alves was a vocal and active member of the Fractionalist portion of the MPLA, pushing for stronger relationships with the Soviet Union and stronger reparations from mestizo and whites in Angola. On May 21, 1977, Alves and a small group broke open the São Paulo Prison, in an attempt to lead a charge against the presidential palace. Neto, aware of the coup attempt beforehand, had moved his base of operations to the Ministry of Defense, and launched a counter-offensive with the help of Cuban forces. Within the day, the coup had been defeated.

							After the coup attempt, a purge began within the MPLA. Over two thousand accused dissidents were executed, which included Urbano de Castro, David Zè, and Artur Nunes. de Castro was 35, Zè was 32, and Nunes was only 26. We don't know why they were killed, or where they were buried. For the next decade, their music was banned from public airwaves within Angola, and the MPLA tried to remove them from the public record. To this day, all we have is speculation over why they were included in the list of those un-personed within Angola. Some say it was because they helped leak information to the Fractionalists. Some say it was because president Neto started to worry about their popularity overtaking his own. The unfortunate truth is that we don't know, and there's a good chance that we never will.

							Thankfully, as I've mentioned, there is a recent revival in interest in these artists, and some of their music has managed to survive. In particular, we'll look at one song by each artist. Before we do though, we should explain that Angola had developed a bit of an international identity when it comes to music sources. Having been a colony of Portugal for nearly 300 years, much of the cultural landscape that was popular in Portugal made it's way to Angola. Because of this, styles such as Merengue, Rumba, and Bolero were integrated into Angolan culture, with the addition of a new style called Semba. Semba is to Angola what Samba is to Brazil. Both developed as an integration of the local culture with the colonial culture, with each creating something unique that found a wider audience.
							<br>
							<br>
							Outside of this information, almost nothing is known about the process behind these songs, so most of the information regarding instrumentation
